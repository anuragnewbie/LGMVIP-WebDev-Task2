This is a React based project, task 2 of my web development internship
at LetsGrowMore.

Here I have used React Hooks and made an API call to fetch the LGM users
details and displayed it in my web application. 

I have used html, css, javascript, bootstrap framework, react hooks.

Hope you will like it. 😁
